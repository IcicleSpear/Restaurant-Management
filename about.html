        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Eating is something that everyone loves to do, and what's better than sitting in the comfort of your home, reading your favorite book, watching some show or film or just idling with your family & friends and ordering food from your favorite restaurant at your fingertips.Food delivery apps are a new rage, from restaurant owners making their own food ordering app for you to deliver food while sitting on your couch to services like foodpanda, swiggy, zomato which act as a collaboration platform between the restaurants and clients."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ourselves Abhishek,Jagan,Lathish of Saveetha Enginnering college have created this food order website with html css for the frontend and we have used sql and php for the back end</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hope you have liked it :)<p>
